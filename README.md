# Starting Tips

## Cobblegen

Q. How do I make a Cobble Generator (cobblegen)?

A. Make a "T" shape, 4 wide, water on one end, lava on other end.


```
   Side View    Top View
   BWwXLB       sWWxLs
    Bw B

Legend:
  B Solid Block
  W Water (Source)
  w Water (Flowing)
  L Lava
  x Cobblestone/Stone (Generated)
```

## Lava

Get enough Iron Ingots to make a _Cauldron_ then buy:

```
/shop dripstone block
/shop pointed dripstone
```

## Bone Meal

There is no _Bone Meal_ in the `/shop`.

* DON'T buy _Bone Block_ via `/shop bone block #`
* DO    buy _Bone_       via `/shop bone #`

```
       $352.45       $14.10 Bone Block
        $21.71        $1.26 Bone

1x Bone Block = $352.45 -> 9x Bone Meal
3x Bone       =  $64.14 -> 9x Bone Meal
```

This way you can save $3,000 / Lava Bucket.

## Money Making


0. `/shop smoker`                 1x @ $200 =    -$200 one time purchase
1. `/shop magma block`            1x @ $250 =    -$250 one time purchase
2. `/shop white stained glass 4`  4x @ $100 =    -$400 one time purchase
3. `/shop 5` and buy 64 Emeralds 64x @ $    = -$25,600
4. Buy 16 _bucket of cod_ for    16x @ 3e   =     -48e
5. Place 16 _raw cod_ and 2 _Coal_ into smoker
6. Sell _Cooked Cod_             16x @ $    = +$37,995.23
